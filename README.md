# **General Audience Abstract**
### Under the Department of Energy’s Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) program at Argonne National Laboratory, I spent nine weeks developing a reproducible, Python‑based workflow for analyzing urban air quality and meteorological data. In the first phase, I established my computational environment by installing Python packages, configuring Git and GitHub access through Jupyter notebooks, and surveying the scientific literature on aerosol and trace‐gas measurements. I then acquired high‐resolution datasets from CROCUS at Northeastern Illinois University’s rooftop sensors and Vaisala weather stations, confirming variable definitions and organizing raw files into a single dataset file. Next, I implemented data processing routines to aggregate measurements over multiple time scales (1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 minutes) and saved each resulting dataset as NetCDF files, ensuring compatibility with common climate‐analysis tools. The final time scale used was 30 minutes. After filtering and standardizing variables – including decomposing wind speed and direction into U and V components – I applied K Means clustering to identify distinct pollution regimes. Diagnostic visualizations such as pair plots, box plots, elbow plots, mosaic plots, and cluster‐centroid treemaps revealed patterns in particulate matter, ozone, and co‐pollutants associated with traffic emissions, wildfire smoke, and background conditions. Building on these findings, I produced a scientific poster and a formal report, and authored what you are reading now: a general‑audience abstract aimed at broadening public understanding of air‐quality science. I also packaged my code into a GitHub repository, enabling future users to reproduce and extend the analysis. Throughout the internship, I used best practices in code development – unit testing, documentation, and collaboration with my mentor and peers – and honed my skills in data visualization and scientific communication. My work directly supports the DOE’s mission to advance environmental monitoring and modeling capabilities by demonstrating how open‑source tools can streamline the processing and interpretation of large‐volume sensor data. The resulting deliverables – a cleaned, multi‐scale air‐quality dataset; an open GitHub repository; and a set of engaging figures – provide a foundation for ongoing research into urban pollution dynamics. Personally, I gained confidence in managing complex datasets, translating technical results for non‑specialist audiences, and collaborating in a research environment. This experience has solidified my interest in atmospheric science and equipped me with skills that will benefit future projects aligned with the Department of Energy’s commitment to clean air and sustainable communities.

# **Important Figures**
### Figure 1<br>![alt text](https://github.com/z3288/Chicago-Air-Quality-SULI/blob/main/Fig1.png "Figure 1")<br>Variable treemaps for each of the five clusters, where the tile area reflects the standardized deviation of each pollutant or meteorological variable from its overall mean. The negative values are below the standard deviation and positive values are above the standard deviation

### Figure 2<br>![alt text](https://github.com/z3288/Chicago-Air-Quality-SULI/blob/main/Fig2.png "Figure 2")<br>This composite view summarizes the five clusters: the bar chart (top left) shows each cluster’s relative frequency; the line plot (top right) displays their average hourly occurrence (UTC), highlighting smog, daytime, smoke, background, and nighttime signatures; and the timeline (bottom) displays cluster assignments over May 20, 2023 through August 30, 2023, with light gray shading marking wildfire smoke periods, red bands indicating intense smoke events, and a dashed line on July 4 for fireworks

### Figure 3<br>![alt text](https://github.com/z3288/Chicago-Air-Quality-SULI/blob/main/Fig3.png "Figure 3")<br>Boxplots of air quality and meteorological variables by cluster, illustrating distributions in particulate matter, gases, temperature, dewpoint, and wind components. Each cluster’s unique signature – ranging from intense smoke and smog to nocturnal and background conditions – is clearly differentiated by the position and spread of the boxes
