# This repository holds the source code package from CROCUS NEIU 2023 to produce air quality and weather sensor dataset and figures
#### *Coded by Brandon Swanson<br>Mentored by Bhupendra Raut and Joe O'Brien*
-----------------
### Below are some important figures produced from the Jupyter Notebook files during my appointment at Argonne National Labratory. Use the Main_cleaned.ipynb file first with both AQT and WXT sensor data in netCDF file format. Then use the plots_cleaned.ipynb with the new dataset to gain new figures.

# **Important Figures**
### Figure 1<br>![alt text](https://github.com/z3288/Chicago-Air-Quality-SULI/blob/main/Fig1.png "Figure 1")<br>Variable treemaps for each of the five clusters, where the tile area reflects the standardized deviation of each pollutant or meteorological variable from its overall mean. The negative values are below the standard deviation and positive values are above the standard deviation

### Figure 2<br>![alt text](https://github.com/z3288/Chicago-Air-Quality-SULI/blob/main/Fig2.png "Figure 2")<br>This composite view summarizes the five clusters: the bar chart (top left) shows each cluster’s relative frequency; the line plot (top right) displays their average hourly occurrence (UTC), highlighting smog, daytime, smoke, background, and nighttime signatures; and the timeline (bottom) displays cluster assignments over May 20, 2023 through August 30, 2023, with light gray shading marking wildfire smoke periods, red bands indicating intense smoke events, and a dashed line on July 4 for fireworks

### Figure 3<br>![alt text](https://github.com/z3288/Chicago-Air-Quality-SULI/blob/main/Fig3.png "Figure 3")<br>Boxplots of air quality and meteorological variables by cluster, illustrating distributions in particulate matter, gases, temperature, dewpoint, and wind components. Each cluster’s unique signature – ranging from intense smoke and smog to nocturnal and background conditions – is clearly differentiated by the position and spread of the boxes
